# Title: 
Longest Substring
# Estimated Time:
2 h
# Difficulty Level:
Beginner to Intermediate
# Prerequisites:
2.6 Python Basics - Functions
# Topics:
Command line input and output. Using variables and control flow structures. Using while loops and lists. 
# Scenario:
In this project, you will create a function that takes in two strings as input and calculates the longest substring that is common to both strings. The function will return the longest common substring.
The exact problem definition that your function should solve is the following:
Given two strings,S of length m and T of length n, find a longest string which is substring of both S and T.
## Features:
1. The function takes in two strings as input.
2. The function calculates the longest substring that is common to both strings.
3. The function returns the longest common substring.
4. The function handles cases where there are no common substrings.
5. The function can handle uppercase and lowercase characters.
6. The function can handle special characters and white spaces.
7. The function can handle strings of any length.
## Additional Information
According to Wikipedia in computer science, a longest common substring of two or more strings is a longest string that is a substring of all of them. There may be more than one longest common substring. Applications include data deduplication and plagiarism detection. Also DNA similarity. For example If we have two unrelated sequences of DNA the longest common substring of the two sequences provides a measure of their similarity.
There are two similar problems in computer science that could be confused: the longest common substring problem and the longest common subsequence problem. The former looks for uninterrupted matches and the latter allows for interruptions in matches in either input. Here we are concerned with substrings, not subsequences.
